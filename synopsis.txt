                              PROJECT SYNOPSIS
                                  PicMe
          Automated Event Photo Discovery Using Facial Recognition
================================================================================

1. INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

PicMe is an intelligent web-based platform that revolutionizes how people find 
their photos at events. Using advanced facial recognition technology, PicMe 
automatically identifies and organizes event photos, eliminating the tedious 
process of manually searching through thousands of images.

The platform serves two primary user groups:
- Event Organizers/Admins: Upload and manage event photos, create events, and 
  maintain their organization's photo galleries
- Event Attendees/Users: Discover their photos automatically by scanning their 
  face, download images, and maintain personal photo collections

Built with Flask (Python) backend and modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, 
PicMe leverages the DeepFace library for facial recognition, providing accurate 
and privacy-conscious photo matching.


2. MOTIVATION
================================================================================

Traditional Challenges:
- At large events (festivals, conferences, weddings), professional photographers 
  capture thousands of photos
- Attendees spend hours manually browsing through photo galleries trying to 
  find pictures of themselves
- Event organizers struggle to efficiently distribute photos to the right people
- Privacy concerns arise when all photos are publicly accessible
- No centralized system exists to manage photos across multiple events

Real-World Impact:
- A typical music festival generates 5,000+ photos across multiple photographers
- Attendees miss out on great photos because they can't find them
- Event organizers receive countless requests: "Do you have photos of me?"
- Professional photographers' work doesn't reach the intended subjects

PicMe Solution:
- Automated photo discovery using facial recognition
- Privacy-first approach: individual photos only visible after face scan
- Centralized platform for multiple events and organizations
- Seamless experience for both organizers and attendees


3. CHALLENGES
================================================================================

Technical Challenges:

a) Facial Recognition Accuracy
   - Challenge: Varying lighting conditions, angles, and photo quality at events
   - Solution: Implemented DeepFace with multiple detection backends (OpenCV, 
     SSD, Dlib) and robust preprocessing pipeline

b) Performance & Scalability
   - Challenge: Processing thousands of photos with facial recognition is 
     computationally intensive
   - Solution: Implemented caching mechanisms, optimized database queries, 
     background processing, and efficient file storage structure

c) Privacy & Security
   - Challenge: Protecting user biometric data and ensuring only authorized 
     access to photos
   - Solution: Store only facial embeddings (not actual photos), implement 
     session-based authentication, separate public/private photo access

d) Real-Time Synchronization
   - Challenge: Ensuring admin edits reflect immediately on user dashboards
   - Solution: Implemented cache-busting strategies, atomic file writes, and 
     proper cache invalidation mechanisms

e) Multi-User Concurrency
   - Challenge: Multiple admins and users accessing the system simultaneously
   - Solution: Implemented proper session management, database locking, and 
     atomic operations for data consistency

f) Cross-Browser Compatibility
   - Challenge: Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers and 
     devices
   - Solution: Used modern web standards, responsive design with Tailwind CSS, 
     and progressive enhancement techniques
